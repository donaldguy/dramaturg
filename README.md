In theater, a dramaturg (or "literary manager") is a behind-the-scenes individual who researches and advises in the development of dramatic scripts and productions.

This library hopes to allow you to fulfill a similar role, but for shell scripts and cli workflows.

In particular, in the spirit of devops and "learn by doing", it seeks to empower those in-the-know (e.g. ops-types or senior developers) to deliver a workflow to those-less-so (e.g. junior developers) that can be executed outrightâ€”or easily departed from as desired & appropriate for the user's level of familiarity with the tools & proccess.
